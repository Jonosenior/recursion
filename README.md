# Recursive Functions

This project contains several recursive programs. Chief among them is my implementation of merge sort, which uses recursion to sort an array significantly faster than bubble sort (a previous project) on most data sets.

The basic structure of merge sort is to 'divide and conquer'. It repeatedly splits an array in half and then half again, until the 'base case' is reached - an array with a single element. It then combines ('merges') each sub-array to finally produce a sorted array.

It's a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion).
